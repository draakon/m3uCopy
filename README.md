m3uCopy
=======

Simple command-line tool to copy all files from a playlist (e.g. m3u, m3u8) to a destination directory.

Supports UTF-8. Actually that was main reason why I had to create this simple program: I tried handful of other similar tools and they all had trouble with files containing UTF-8 characters.
Of course, there may be some (or a lot) that work fine, but it was quicker to write my own at that time.

Usage: m3uCopy [PLAYLIST FILE] [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]
